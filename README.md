GitHub + Vault Integration Example
This repository demonstrates how to integrate HashiCorp Vault with GitHub to manage secrets and access them in a GitHub Actions workflow.

Prerequisites
HashiCorp Vault installed and running.
GitHub account and repository.
Administrative privileges on Vault.
Setup Vault
Start Vault Server

Ensure your Vault server is running and accessible. If not, start it using the appropriate command:

vault server -config=config.hcl
Authenticate to Vault

Authenticate to Vault with a token that has sufficient permissions to mount secret engines:

vault login <your-sudo-token>
Replace <your-sudo-token> with your Vault token that has sudo capabilities.

Enable the KV (Key-Value) Secrets Engine

Mount the KV secrets engine at the desired path (e.g., github-secrets):

vault secrets enable -path=github-secrets kv
Store Secrets in Vault

Store a secret in Vault:

vault kv put github-secrets/myapp/config username='myuser' password='mypassword'
Setup GitHub Actions
Create GitHub Actions Workflow

Create a GitHub Actions workflow file in your repository. For example, .github/workflows/deploy.yml:

name: Deploy

on: [push]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Install Vault
      run: |
        curl -fsSL https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
        sudo apt-add-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main"
        sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install vault

    - name: Authenticate to Vault
      env:
        VAULT_ADDR: ${{ secrets.VAULT_ADDR }}
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      run: |
        vault login -method=github token=${GITHUB_TOKEN}

    - name: Retrieve secrets
      run: |
        vault kv get -format=json github-secrets/myapp/config | jq -r .data.data.username
        vault kv get -format=json github-secrets/myapp/config | jq -r .data.data.password
